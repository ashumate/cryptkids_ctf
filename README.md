<h2>This is the basic configuration and setup information for the Cryptkids (BSdiesDC Kids) CTF.</h2>

Hardware:
2 1U servers - Supermicro X9SCL with 500G drives and 32G memory running ESXi
1 TP-Link 8 port switch with PoE out
2 TP-Link 8 port switches with PoE in
1 TP-Link Wap
10 Lenovo T420 laptops

Premise, players can interact with the CTF multiple ways:
- Using one of my laptops
- Using their own laptop with their tools
- Using their own laptop and a live boot environmnet
- Using their own device and a VM provided by me

All questions/challenges can be easily solved using some google searches
Locks have been added for physical challenges

The only tools needed should be nmap, john the ripper, aircrack-ng, a tool to change user agent strings (need to update after playtest)
